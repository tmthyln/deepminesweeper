# deepminesweeper (Deep Learning Minesweeper)
Minesweeper is a grid-based game of pure logic and pure chance. Can a computer learn to play it well? Better than humans?

## Rules of the Game


## Learning Models
- learn a reinforcement algorithm that plays the game and develops a sense of the logic
- train a reinforcement GAN to learn to play the game better in worse conditions
  - discriminator plays the game
  - generator produces difficult game boards
